# projective-transformation
First homework for Projective Geometry course at the Faculty of Mathematics in Belgrade, Serbia.
Implementation of 3 projective transformation algorithms:
- naive
- direct linear transformation (DLT)
- normalized dlt algorithm.

## Requirements
Done in Qt5, using [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)  and [QCustomPlot](https://www.qcustomplot.com/) C++ libraries.
